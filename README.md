# Staff-Bot

A Discord bot made in discord.js for Discord server staffs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) atleast 10.x.x version.
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. [A Discord Account](https://discordapp.com)
4. [A Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
  1. Log in with your Discord account
  2. Go to Applications
  3. Hiw _New Application_
  4. Give the bot a name then save the changes.
  5. Then on the menu, click on Bot then click on _Add Bot_ and confirm.
  6. You should see a _Copy Token_, click on it and store it somewhere, you'll need it.

### Installing

1. Download and extract the files or create a folder on your desktop and inside it do ``git clone https://github.com/moruzerinho6/Staff-bot``.

2. After downloading the content, enter the created file and open a prompt command window(CMD/Bash) inside the folder.

3. Type ``npm i``, if it doesn't work then something might have gonne  wrong with your node.js installation.

4. Open your editor(Recommended: [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)) on that folder and inside the src folder create a ``.env`` file with no name.

5. Inside the .env file there should be 2 keys each with a value:

```
TOKEN=The bot token here
PREFIX=The bot prefix here
```

If you're unfamiliar, prefix means what the message should start with so the bot takes and tries to do something with it.

### Coding style

Staff-bot uses [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) so you should too, click on Stardard to check it's repository and how to install it, I recommend you to do this before trying to work on the code since the eslint'll pretty much not work without you installing it in the global.

The only rule that Staff Bot changes from standard is the use of single quotes that's already said to the interpreter on the .eslintrc.json

If unsure of your coding style you can run ``standard --fix`` outside the src folder os it'll fix everything it can for you.

## Deployment

It is recommended to host custom version on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)
